Brand Affiliated Wallet

Custodial, easy to deploy and easy to use lightning wallets such as the Blue Wallet sparked an idea. They are very easy and with true marketing can spread out like wildfire. I am suggesting Brand Affiliated Wallets. 

Think of your favorite sports team, lets say it is Barcelona FC. Imagine them having a Barcelona FC BAW wallet. The BAW wallet runs on Barcelona FC's node and with each payment you do, the BAW wallet sends out a 2nd micro transaction (to the wallet set by the BAW wallet you use). 

So imagine, retailers in the city of Barcelona accepting payments in bitcoin and people of Barcelona using Barcelona FC BAW wallets. Everytime they do a transaction they support their team. It is also a win for the retailers as they don't pay commisions on credit card and they get the payment instantly (not in 30 days).

Now imagine exanding this to Venezuela for their fight agains opression and Maduro, to Greenpeace, to Cristiano Ronaldo, Selena Gomez and even to Alexandria Ocasio Cortez to fund her campaign.
